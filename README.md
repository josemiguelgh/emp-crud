# emp-crud

### Notes:
* I implemented 3 operations: Select All, Select by Name, Create (employees). Those work properly interacting with the API.
* URLs and Tokens are in the class that (for the moment) uses them. I know this is not the best practice and that is preferred to have those values in .config files with encryption. But for the sake of simplicity I left them in the class.
